# Advent of Code 2020 Participation Log
https://adventofcode.com/2020/
A coding challenge released every day from Dec 01 - Dec 25.
Language is primarily Python.

## Is this challenge for me? 
Frankly, I have very little formal coding education, and I managed!
Some days were harder than others, and I definitely stumbled into a few oddly specific computer science rabbit holes in the process, but if you're interested in
learning these concepts regardless, I think it's well worth it!
